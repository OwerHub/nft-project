This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I create a landing page that I make based on incoming plant. 

## Getting Started

FFirst, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To see the landing page [http://localhost:3000/landing](http://localhost:3000/landing) with your browser to see the result.
